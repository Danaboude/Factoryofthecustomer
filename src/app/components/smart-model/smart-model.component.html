                    When we speak about Smart Knowledge, we refer to self-awareness . This is not automation but an
                    “intelligent automation” or “automation with a human touch”. We speak about autonomation. The main
                    difference is that autonomation implements some supervisory functions rather than production
                    functions. Human and machine act together. As a human you have to learn to think and communicate
                    with the machine. This goes further then digitalizing: they use algorithms. A really simple example
                    is the use of a gps, if you change direction the algorithm will adapt and suggest new ways/
                    directions. Within industry you can find also a lot of Examples.

                    When we speak about Smart Technology, we refer to self-creating process. You can also use the word
                    automation. Automation is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed with minimal
                    human assistance. Automation use various control systems for an operating equipment. Most of the
                    time old or traditional ways of doing, or processes are digitized. The priority in this direction is
                    that you learn to observe and see which action can easily be automated. Industrial robots are seen
                    in manufacturing plants all over the world. For example, Industrial robots can easily do industrial
                    tasks such as spot welding, machine loading, cutting.

                    Smart organization is more about self-organization. There is a cooperation and interaction. We can
                    talk about technology but the emphasizes is how we can work better together with or without the use
                    of technology. This can mean to organize your plant, or the organogram of your company. There are
                    new organizational forms like Holocracy Semco Style, Teal organizations. Those 3 directions have an
                    impact on one another and within smart organization you learn to adapt yourself and your team to
                    those changes. The last direction is more social and cultural influenced then the other two.
