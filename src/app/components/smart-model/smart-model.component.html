                        When we speak about Smart Knowledge, we refer to self-awareness. This is not automation but an
                        “intelligent automation” or “automation with a human touch”. We speak about autonomation. The
                        main difference is that autonomation implements some supervisory functions rather than
                        production functions.

                        When we speak about Smart Technology, we refer to self-creating process. You can also use the
                        word automation. Automation is the technology by which a process or procedure is performed with
                        minimal human assistance. Automation uses various control systems for an operating equipment,
                        Most of the time old or traditional ways of doing.

                        Smart organization is more about self-organization. There is a cooperation and interaction. We
                        can talk about technology but the emphasis is how we can work better together with or without
                        the use of technology. This can mean to organize your plant, or the organogram of your company.
